### Lending Club Case Study
> Outline a brief description of your project.
- When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the 
- Applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to 
- a financial loss for the company

- The data given below contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. 
- The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking 
- Actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

## Conclusions
- Max loans are taken for Debt Consolidation(46.93)
- Around 14% loans were charged off
- Observation is that Loan amount, investor amount, funding amount are strongly correlated.
- Annual income with DTI(Debt-to-income ratio) is negatively correalted.
- Debt income ratio is the percentage of a consumer's monthly gross income that goes toward paying debts. 
- That means when annual income is low DTI is high & vice versa.
- Positive correlation between annual income and employment years.
- That means income increases with work experience
- Most of the Loan amounts are in range of 5000 - 15000
- Most of the borrower's Annual incomes are in range of 40000- 80000
- Number of chraged off count also high too for Debt Consolidation
- Most of them living in rented home or mortgazed their home.
- Applicant numbers are high from these categories so charged off is high too.
- Applicants those who had taken loan to repay in 60 months had more percentage of number of applicants getting charged off as compared to applicants who had taken loan for 36 months.
- Increase in annual income charged off proportion got decreased.
- Chances of charged of is increasing with grade moving from "A" towards "G"
- Proportion of charged off is increasing with sub grades moving from sub grades of "A" towards sub grades of "G"
- Charged off proportion is increasing with higher intrest rates.
- Those who are not working or have less than 1 year of work experience have high chances of getting charged off.
- Those who already have pub_rec_bankruptcies value 1, have charged off proportion higher than who have no pub_rec_bankruptcies
- Higher the intrest rate higher charged off ratio
- Higher the annual income higher the loan amount slightly.
- Increase in number of charged off with increase in year.
- Intrest rate is increasing with loan amount increase
